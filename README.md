# windows-memory-evasion
This repository demonstrates advanced Windows memory evasion techniques for educational and research purposes only. It includes modules for self-injection, process injection, PPID spoofing, and DLL injection, featuring AES-128 encrypted payloads and API hashing for enhanced stealth.



# 🔒 Malware Development Research 

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Disclaimer

This repository contains **malware development techniques** strictly for **educational**, **defensive**, and **research** purposes. The knowledge shared here aims to:

- Help security researchers understand modern evasion and injection techniques.
- Aid red teamers in simulating advanced adversaries.
- Provide defenders with insight into how attackers think and build.

> **Do not** use this code for unauthorized access, exploitation, harm, or disruption of systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## 🧠 Techniques Covered

This repository includes techniques such as:

- Shellcode injection (self, remote, process hollowing)
- PPID spoofing
- API hashing and dynamic resolution
- AES/XOR shellcode encryption and decryption
- Stealth memory allocation and execution

Each module is explained with inline comments and accompanied by a detailed README for clarity.

## ⚖️ Responsibility

By using or modifying this code, **you accept full responsibility** for how it is used. This includes ensuring:

- All testing is performed in isolated environments (e.g., VMs, sandboxes).
- You have legal authorization for any system you test.
- You do not distribute or deploy these techniques for malicious use.

If you are unsure whether your usage is ethical or legal — **stop** and consult a security professional or legal advisor.

## 👨‍🏫 Intended Audience

- Malware analysts
- Penetration testers & red teamers
- Cybersecurity students
- Security product developers (EDR/AV evasion testing)

---

## 🧪 Testing

Always test in **safe, isolated, and offline environments** such as:

- Virtual machines (VirtualBox, VMware)
- Sandboxed environments
- Physical air-gapped systems

Never test this code on production systems or networks.

## 📢 Final Word

> **This is a double-edged sword**: the same knowledge that helps you understand attackers can also empower them. Use it wisely. Use it ethically.

We stand for **security**, **education**, and **defense** — not exploitation or harm.
